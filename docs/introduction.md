Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on [node](http://nodejs.org) and the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/visionmedia/mocha).
